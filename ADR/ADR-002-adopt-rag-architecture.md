# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-02-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

On average SAs spend around three hours grading aptitude short answers and eight hours grading case studies. Decreasing the manual hours during grading will help the company scale.

## Decision

To decrease the number of hours expert SAs spend on manual grading tasks, we propose the use
of a RAG architecture and implement a grading assistant.

We do not recommend fine-tuning an LLM due to the high development cost.

## Consequences
